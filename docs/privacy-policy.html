    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>1GoShop does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.</strong></p>
    <p>All shopping list data is stored locally on your device only. The App does not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)</li>
        <li>Track your location</li>
        <li>Use analytics or tracking services</li>
        <li>Share data with third parties</li>
        <li>Require user accounts or registration</li>
        <li>Use cookies or similar technologies</li>
        <li>Access your contacts, photos, or other device data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The App stores your shopping lists and preferences (such as language and theme settings) locally on your device using standard device storage. This data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Never leaves your device</li>
        <li>Is not accessible to the developer or any third party</li>
        <li>Is deleted when you uninstall the App</li>
        <li>Can be exported by you as a file for personal backup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Export and Import</h2>
    <p>The App allows you to export and import shopping lists as files. These files are created and stored on your device. The developer has no access to these files.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect data from anyone, including children under 13. It is safe for users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
